# names_project
Analysis of Polish baby names trends.
In this project I'll use data published by dane.gov.pl containing names given to Polish children from 2000 to 2021.
Target of this analysis is to find the most popular names, but also the most and the least stable ones.

Pandas is used for data importing, cleaning and transforming.
Seaborn is used for plotting.
